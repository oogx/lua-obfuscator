Older Notes for LuaSrcDiet < 0.10 for Lua 5.0.2
-----------------------------------------------

The following is the older README for the Lua 5.0.2 version of
LuaSrcDiet, which is not maintained anymore.

--

INTRODUCTION

LuaSrcDiet reduces the size of Lua 5 source files by aggressively
removing all unnecessary whitespace and comments. This is done using a
work-alike version of the Lua 5.0.2 lexical analyzer which produces
additional information on whitespace and comments. Token processing is
then performed and what can be cut, is cut. The script finally verifies
correctness of the generated file by running the result through its
internal lexer again.

LuaSrcDiet is written as a single self-contained Lua script.
LuaSrcDiet_.lua is a sample output file processed at maximum reduction;
a Lua 5.0.2 command line executable should be able to run it.

WARNING: Whitespace removal is very aggressive but should be valid for
the Lua 5.0.2 lexer. This is assuming that LuaSrcDiet's lexer behaves
*exactly* like Lua 5.0.2's lexer. I have not analyzed the current Lua
5.1wk4 lexer in detail, so the output MAY FAIL on Lua 5.1wk4 (Lua 5.1
will be supported in the future.)

LuaSrcDiet currently optimizes based on tokens only. It does not
currently support optimization methods that require the token stream to
be parsed, e.g. optimizing constant numbers and strings or renaming
locals. Such methods are future TODOs, but unlikely to be implemented
anytime soon. Code contributions are welcome.

WHAT'S NEW

Major changes for version 0.9.1 (see the ChangeLog as well):
* Fixed a bug in the lexer
* Added a --dump option for dumping a raw token list

Major changes for version 0.9.0 (see the ChangeLog as well):
* Preliminary release, for Lua 5.0.2. Beta quality.

USAGE OPTIONS

usage: lua LuaSrcDiet.lua [options] [filenames]

options:
  -h, --help        prints usage information
  -o <file>         specify file name to write output
  --quiet           do not display statistics
  --read-only       read file and print token stats
  --keep-lines      preserve line numbering
  --maximum         maximize reduction of source
  --dump            dump raw tokens from lexer
  --                stop handling arguments

example:
  >lua LuaSrcDiet.lua myscript.lua -o myscript_.lua

USING LUASRCDIET

By default, LuaSrcDiet names the output file by adding an underscore to
the basename of the source file. Some statistical information is shown
by default. "Total Tokens" is the number of tokens that will be actually
lexed by the Lua 5.0.2 parser, while "Total Elements" is the total of
tokens plus whitespace and comment elements.

If you wish to preserve line numbering, use --keep-lines to leave empty
lines in the output. So if you are debugging, an error message will show
the same line number as your original uncompressed sources.

To see the token statistics of LuaSrcDiet.lua itself ('...' denote the
title information normally displayed by LuaSrcDiet) without doing any
processing or generating an output file:

    >lua LuaSrcDiet.lua LuaSrcDiet.lua --read-only
    ...

Note that 'real' tokens that are lexed by Lua 5.0.2 does not change;
LuaSrcDiet does not perform any heavy-duty optimizations at the moment.
The 'before' and 'after' token stream is always compared to ensure that
the reduction or compression process is correct.

To compress using maximum settings:

The --maximum option additionally removes unnecessary line endings, at
the cost of reduced readability.

CODE SIZE REDUCTION

There are 3 options for output generation: the default, --keep-lines and
--maximum. The following table details what each option does:

Reduction Scheme                (default) --keep-lines --maximum
----------------------------------------------------------------
Removal of comments                 Y           Y          Y
Removal of block comments           Y           Y          Y
Basic space and tab removal         Y           Y          Y
Delete empty lines                  Y                      Y
Delete all unnecessary EOLs                                Y
----------------------------------------------------------------
*EOL=end-of-line

The default settings keeps your output a little bit more readable than
the maximum setting while cutting out the majority of the unnecessary
bytes in your source file. Actual savings will depend on your coding
style (amount and type of whitespace and comments used.)

--

OTHER OPTIONS

The --dump option performs a complete dump of the raw token list
generated by the LuaSrcDiet lexer. This token list is somewhat different
from the token format of the Lua lexer (llex.c); it includes
non-essential tokens such as EOLs, whitespace and comments, which is
needed for code size reduction processing. Useful for debugging and
diagnostic purposes.

--

BEHAVIOUR NOTES

TK_EOS is always 1 and does not occupy any space.

The TK_EOL count doesn't include newlines inside strings, so it will
probably not be the same as the number of lines in the source file.

For scripts with the 'shell bang' line, the line is preserved unchanged
and is reflected as a single remaining TK_COMMENT element.

The Lua 5.0.2 lexer reads a file line-by-line, so you might find that
LuaSrcDiet handles non-LF line endings incorrectly. It should not affect
the actual token stream, though, so your programs should still work
correctly. If the byte total reported by LuaSrcDiet is different from
the original file, it's probably due to conversion of CRLF line endings
to internal LF line endings. Generated Lua files always have LF line
endings.

If your editor cannot syntax-highlight a reduced Lua source file
properly, try the SciTE editor or a Scintilla-based editor -- it
highlights perfectly.

TODO: For the upcoming Lua 5.1, LuaSrcDiet will later be changed to
handle CR, LF and CRLF line endings transparently, in sync with the
lexer changes.
