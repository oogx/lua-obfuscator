# Modified PSU obfuscator

Modified PSU source code to allow for it to obfuscate files without having to use a outdated .net discord bot.
In the Main folder, you need to build both bot and obf and put the dlls and exe in the Main folder for changes to apply. You can change the file to be obfuscated by changing the settings within Storage.
Then just run the exe and check Storage/Obfuscation and you should see a folder with the "discord id" and your obfuscated file will be called Obfuscated.lua. As simple as that.
